              Our computational pipeline applies multiple 3D convolutional nets to datasets as large as a petavoxel.
              We are applying our pipeline to accelerate research in neuroscience labs around the world.
              We are also a key player in BRAIN CONNECTS, one of the three transformative projects of the US BRAIN Initiative.
              BRAIN CONNECTS is an ambitious ten-year project to map a whole mouse brain at synaptic resolution, turning the dream of exascale connectomics into reality.

              During the 1982 meeting of the Society for Neuroscience, which was held in Minneapolis, Minnesota, 8 Korean neuroscientists got together 
              in a local restaurant and agreed to have annual gatherings of Korean neuroscientists at subsequent meetings of the Society.
              As the number of members in the Society for Neuroscience increased, the number of Korean neuroscientist members grew as well and
              more Korean neuroscientists attended the annual dinner meeting each year. 
              In 1988, at the Toronto, Canada meeting, bylaws were adopted (click here to view the bylaws) and the Association was formally founded.
              There have been well over 250 Korean neuroscientists in attendance at recent annual dinner meetings.

              We do this from two different perspectives. 
              On the one hand, we explore the fundamental mechanisms that allow axons to navigate intermediate targets on their way to the final target.
              On the other hand, we start with patient-derived candidate genes and study their contribution to neural development as a means to understand the patient's symptoms.
              We use both chicken and mouse embryos as model organisms for nervous system development.

              We study the biological mechanisms underlying cognition from a network perspective.
              Brain networks span from the micro-scale of neurons and synapses to the macro-scale of long range connections between brain regions.
              We investigate how networks connect levels of organization in the brain and how they link structure to function. We also investigate pathophysiology and try to find treatment modalities of diseases that give perturbation to cognitive functions such as Alzheimer's disease.
              For these purposes, we mainly use in vivo imaging modalities such as two-photon microscopy, near-infrared fluorescence imaging, EEG and MRI.
              Images are obtained from human subjects and animal models to investigate how the integrative nature of brain function can be illuminated from a microlevel network to a large scale network.
              Through this we want to understand the higher cognitive functions of human brain (how the brain works) and to develop restoration, augmentation and modulation systems for patients with brain dysfunctions using current cutting-edge bioengineering techniques.

              The ultimate goal of the DECISION Brain Dynamics Laboratory in KAIST (PI: Prof. Jaeseung Jeong) is to understand the complex brain mechanism underlying decision-making and social cognition and their impairments in neuropsychiatric disorders.
              To achieve this goal, we use neuroimaging methods including EEG/fMRI and computational modeling tools to investigate how cortical-subcortical circuits work during decision-making and social cognition.
              We attempt to develop the integrative models of impaired cognitive processes in neuropsychiatric disorders and develop brain-computer
              Interface techniques for therapeutic neuromodulations of neuropsychiatric patients and robot-animal group controls.
              In addition, we study how the brain produces aesthetic preference on paintings and music and how it manipulates social communications between humans.

              Animals in the wild encounter many types of external stimuli such as threat and food,
              and must exhibit appropriate responses for survival. How does a brain recognize such
              stimuli with sensory systems, create internal representations of these external stimuli,
              and then elicit appropriate behavioral responses?
              To address this problem, we take systems approach and use the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster,
              because of a wealth of genetic tools available, a relatively simple brain, and a complex, interesting
              behavioral repertoire. Rapidly emerging tools also permit relatively facile identification of neural
              substrates. We recently launched studies using mice in addition to fruit flies. Our focus has been to identify neurons that subserve a particular innate behavior, apply functional imaging and electro-
              physiology to probe their activity, therefore, define precisely contributions of each set of neurons
              to behavior. We are currently interested in identification and characterization of post-ingestive,
              internal sensors that detect the nutritional value of carbohydrate, fats and protein (macronutrients),
              and micronutrients in Drosophila. We are extending this line of work in mice to elucidate the
              identities and characteristics of the mammalian nutrient sensors, and understand the mechanisms
              by which these sensors contribute to feeding and metabolism. Among a number of discoveries that our laboratory has made thus far, we have contributed
              significantly to understanding the function of Glucose-sensing neurons in the brain. Glucose-sensing
              neurons were identified initially by electrophysiological recordings (Oomura et al., 1964 Science),
              but the physiological function mediated by these neurons in animals were unclear until recently.
              We have been able to elucidate their function using Drosophila: 1) the nutritional content of sugar,
              rather than its palatability, was detected by a discrete population of glucose-excited neurons (termed
              DH44 neurons) that promote sugar consumption (Dus et al., 2015 Neuron and 2011 PNAS, Oh et al., 2021 Neuron) and 2) a pair of glucose-excited neurons (termed CN neurons) regulate the two key endocrine axes: insulin and glucagon (Oh et al., 2019 Nature).
              These are a series of significant discoveries because approximately 10-15% of neurons in our brain are glucose-sensing, but it has taken over 50 years to reveal their physiological function in an animal.
              Understanding the functions of glucose-sensing in Drosophila would provide a foundation for studying their functions in mice and humans, and developing therapeutic potentials for health issues such as obesity, diabetes, eating disorders.
              In addition to the studies of glucose-sensing, we have identified and characterized neural circuits mediating the detection and response to the deprivation of amino acids (Kim et al., 2021 Nature), 
              and other macronutrients, as well as essential micronutrients (see a Review by Kim et al, 2021 Cell Metabolism).

              How do we perceive the world? Inputs from the external world, i.e., sensory stimuli, need to be actively processed in the brain to be transformed into a "percept".
              Sensory processing (computation of sensory stimuli in the brain) is the gateway to sensory perception, and efficient sensory processing is required for the perceptual behavior of the animal.
              Switching from a drowsy, inattentive behavioral state to an aroused, the attentive state is crucial for the effective perception of relevant sensory stimuli and execution of cognitively demanding tasks.
              How do our brain circuits execute this amazing function? We answer this question by studying the following topics in the mouse animal model:
              - Modality-specific sensory processing;
              - Selective attention and modulation of perception;
              - Multisensory integration and cross-modal binding;
              - Perceptual decision and sensorimotor transformation;
              - Social perception;
              Our research aims to unravel brain circuits that are important for selective attention, multisensory integration, and behavioral decision, which are critical for cognitive and perceptual behaviors.
              Insights from our study should be broadly applicable to the treatment of cognitive disorders, including attention deficit disorder, autism, schizophrenia, and dementia.

              Our goal is to understand the neural mechanisms that support decision making and episodic memory. 
              We investigate how neural processes underlying these functions are implemented in the rodent brain by examining discharge characteristics of neuronal ensembles in behaving animals, by examining the effects of manipulating specific neural systems on animal behavior and neural activity, and by computational modeling.
              Neural basis of episodic memory.
              Notwithstanding intensive and extensive investigations for the past few decades, neural circuit mechanisms underlying hippocampal mnemonic processing are far from being clear.
              We have proposed a new model for hippocampal function—the binding-simulation-selection model—to account for new empirical findings and to make sense of why the hippocampus has evolved not only to remember but also to imagine episodes.
              Under this working hypothesis, we investigate how simulation-selection processes are implemented in CA3-CA1 networks, concentrating on value-dependent online and offline activities of hippocampal neurons and the role of dopamine in these processes.
              We also investigate hippocampal-neocortical interactions to understand how valuable sequences, that are selected by CA1, are stored as long-term memories in neocortical areas.
              Neural basis of decision making.
              Under the broad category of decision making, we investigate functional microcircuits in the frontal cortex underlying adaptive control of behavior.
              Specific topics include reward-based learning, value representation, value-dependent action selection, and working memory.
              We investigate how different types of excitatory and inhibitory neurons embedded in the frontal cortex neural circuitry process and store information for flexible control of behavior in a way to maximize a long-term sum of rewards. 
              Neural basis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
              We investigate how ASD symptoms might be linked to abnormalities in the hippocampal and frontal cortical neural processes.
              Specifically, we investigate how hippocampal and frontal cortical neural activity differs between wild-type and ASD model mice under diverse behavioral settings such as perceptual decision making and social interactions.

              We pursue the hypothesis that computations are performed in the high dimensional dynamic state space provided by the non-linear dynamics that evolve in the recurrent network of delay coupled oscillatory circuits.
              Core assumptions are:
              i) information about statistical contingencies in natural scenes is contained in the weight distributions of recurrent connections and expressed in temporal correlations among the discharges of feature specific neurons;
              ii) information conveyed by top down projections as a function of attention and expectancy is also manifest in the correlation structure of distributed neuron populations and
              iii) if sensory evidence matches the predictions stored in the functional architecture of the recurrent networks and/or the expectancies conveyed by top down projections, network dynamics converge to states characterized by increased coherence (synchrony) and specific correlation patterns.
              To test the predictions of this conceptual framework we investigate population dynamics with cellular resolution by performing massive parallel recordings from the visual cortex of behaviourally trained monkeys with chronically implanted microelectrode arrays.

              The overall goal of my research program is to develop a theoretically motivated, computationally explicit, and biologically realistic perspective on auditory cognition (including music), speech perception, and language comprehension.
              The work proceeds on three fronts:
              (i) basic physiological properties of human cortex (non-invasive studies of neural encoding);
              (ii) hearing and speech perception (psychophysical and neurobiological approaches); and
              (iii) neurobiological foundations of language.
              These three areas of inquiry are closely related, although not all of the work is necessarily of an interdisciplinary nature.
              The lab uses all available cognitive neuroscience tools.
              The main methods employed include electrophysiological recordings using magnetoencephalography (MEG), electroencephalography (EEG), and electrocorticography (ECoG), as well as imaging studies using structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

              How are neurons connected?
              What are the fundamental principles of wiring in the brain, i.e. what is the connection code? 
              What are the implications for computation and function?
              Just as the gene map carries the rules for the structural design of any given organism, it is thought that the map of all circuits in the brain will help unravel its design principles and reveal much about its functioning.
              A realm of novel techniques has recently emerged allowing the dissection of neural circuits at various levels to ultimately obtain the so-called connectome describing all connections in a given brain area.
              However, as opposed to the genetic system in which the underlying code is well known since the pioneering work on the structure of DNA, the corresponding connection code remains a mystery.
              More than a hundred years ago, however, Ramón y Cajal has suggested to interpret construction plans of the brain by observing the morphology of individual neurons.
              We are now responding to the challenge laid down by Cajal by developing computational tools and mathematical laws to describe this link between structure and function.
              Morphology is key to understanding both circuits and computation since it reflects the constraints given by both.

            description: |
              Humans may not be good at multitasking - but their brains are! At any given moment, a neuronal population may be involved in multiple cognitive processes, such as representing 
              the physical properties of objects in the environment, adjusting for fluctuating attention levels, and implementing the physiological long-term changes that underlie learning.
              Previous research has overwhelmingly focused on studying how each of these cognitive processes affects neuronal activity in isolation.
              In contrast, we want to find out how neuronal activity represents complementary cognitive processes simultaneously at any given moment.
              What's more, we aim to investigate if the solutions to this fundamental challenge of brain computation are evolutionarily preserved, or if they vary across species.
              To study these questions, our lab conducts parallel experiments in the two most dominant model species of neuroscience - monkeys and mice.
              Specifically, we use naturalistic foraging tasks in a virtual environment to examine visually guided decision-making in both species.
              Simultaneously, we record the activity of large neuronal populations in visual cortical areas that are preserved across mammals.
              This approach uniquely allows us to obtain moment-by-moment readouts of the multi-faceted behaviour of animals, which we then relate to various aspects of ongoing brain activity using cutting-edge computational tools.
              In this way, we aim to for the first time explain how the neuronal representations of universal processes like learning and attention jointly unfold in the brain in real time.

              How do we sense our own motion, and how do we orient ourselves when moving in 3D space?
              My laboratory studies these questions by combining mathematical modeling and extracellular neuronal recordings in behaving Marmoset monkeys.
              Some of current research projects are:
              Three-dimensional navigation: I study how head-direction cells in the limbic system (the 'neuronal compass') encode the 3D orientation of the head;
              Sensory signals for spatial navigation: I study how the brain integrates self-motion signals with visual landmarks to maintain spatial orientation;
              Self-motion sensation: I study how the brain merges multiple sensory signals from the inner ear, vision and proprioception, together with motor commands, 
              to create a sense of self-motion that underlies spatial cognition, gaze stabilization and postural control;

              In the lab, we study how the interplay between sensation and cognition give rise to the rich experience that is human perception.
              Present work investigates how images briefly held in mind (in your 'visual working memory') can be remembered in a robust way.
              For example, when you're perceiving the surrounding world while simultaneously holding an image in mind - how can your brain best represent both the percept and the memory? 
              And what happens if you need to pay close attention to your surroundings?
              In addition to perception, working memory, and attention, we're also interested in various states of physiological arousal, how contexts can bias perception, computational neural principles, and much more.
              Importantly, we think that science should be a fun and collaborative form of intellectual entertainment for anyone who wants to be a part of it!

              Neuroscientists have been exploring the representation of space in the brain for decades, discovering a wide range of cell types representing different navigational features.
              The two most prominent of these cell types were identified in the hippocampus and the medial entorhinal cortex:
              Place-modulated hippocampal neurons were found to be active only when an animal moves through a particular location in space (“place cells”). 
              In the medial entorhinal cortex, cells were reported that respond in a periodic activity pattern as an animal moves through the environment (“grid cells”).
              Both cortical regions were found to be highly interconnected, making it plausible to expect interactions between place and grid cells.
              Despite extensive anatomical and functional experiments, the circuitry between grid and place cells, and how they shape each other's activity, 
              and the contribution of local and long-range inhibitory circuits, is still unresolved.
              Our goal is to resolve the networks underlying spatial navigation tasks, in particular the interplay of neurons in the hippocampus 
              and medial entorhinal cortex in mammals, at the single cell and single synapse level
              (i.e. the precise mapping of all point-to-point connections between all involved neurons at their chemical synapses).
              We use cutting-edge 3D electron microscopy methods for large-scale high-resolution mapping of neuronal circuits.

              The lab's research is divided into three research lines: Circuits - Ensembles - Learning (CEL), funded by ERC and BMF grants and support from the ESI:
              Circuits: We investigate how distinct classes of excitatory and inhibitory neurons regulate plasticity and contribute to flexible information processing.
              Ensembles: We investigate how ensembles of neurons encode information through spatio-temporal patterns and what the role of spike sequences and bursting are in information encoding and transmission.
              Furthermore we investigate what the relationship between spontaneous (imagination, dreams) and sensory evoked activity is.
              Learning: We investigate how the brain performs self-supervised learning using predictions of the unknown (in space and time), 
              utilizes parallel features for object recognition (motion, form, texture) and uses recurrent networks for object recognition.
              To answer these kind of questions, we use a variety of techniques and approaches. 
              We employ machine learning techniques to model predictive relationships among sensory inputs - across space and time. 
              We develop new algorithms for unsupervised clustering of high-dimensional neural datasets.
              We use information and neural network theory to understand neural coding.
              We use high-density, multi-areal electrophysiological recordings of neurons, from all cortical layers.
              This allows us to record many neurons at the same time.
              We use optogenetics to identify subtypes of neurons - like interneurons or neurons with specific projection patterns - and modify cortical activity. 
              We classify the state of the organism using e.g. pupil diameter. 
              We develop new types of signal processing techniques to deal with electrophysiological data

              The mission of the MIT Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences is to reverse engineer the brain in order to understand the mind.
              To do that we delve deeply into the mechanisms of the brain at all levels: molecules, synapses, neurons, circuits, algorithms, human behavior, cognition, and everything in between.
              Our headquarters is the largest neuroscience research facility in the world, with some 700 students, postdocs, undergraduates, faculty, and staff all engaged in brain science.

              The Kandel Lab studies explicit memory storage (the conscious recall of information about people, places, and objects) in mice and implicit memory storage in the snail Aplysia.
              By probing the synaptic connections between nerve cells in the humble sea slug, 
              Eric Kandel has uncovered some of the basic molecular mechanisms underlying learning and memory in animals ranging from snails to flies to mice and even in humans.
              His groundbreaking studies have demonstrated the fundamental ways that nerve cells alter their response to chemical signals to produce coordinated changes in behavior.
              This work is central to understanding not only normal memory but also dementia and other mental illnesses that affect memory.
              Kandel's research has shown that learning produces changes in behavior by modifying the strength of connections between nerve cells, rather than by altering the brain's basic circuitry.
              He went on to determine the biochemical changes that accompany memory formation, showing that short-term memory involves 
              a functional modulation of the synapses while long-term memory requires the activation of genes and the synthesis of proteins to grow new synaptic connections.
              For this work, the Austrian-born Kandel was awarded the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

              Cognitive functions of the brain, such as sensory perception, learning and memory, and decision making emerge from computations by neural networks.
              We consider that the advantages of biological neural computation in comparison with machine computation reside in the way that the brain's neural circuits implement computation.
              To uncover neural code and circuit mechanisms of brain computing, we take computational and theoretical approaches.
              Our goal is to construct a minimal but yet effective description of powerful and flexible computation implemented by the brain's neural circuits.

            description: |
              The biological nonlinear dynamics data science unit investigates complex systems explicitly taking into account the role of time.
              We do this by instead of averaging occurrences using their statistics, we treat observations as frames of a movie and if patterns reoccur then we can use their behaviors in the past to predict their future.
              In most cases the systems that we study are part of complex networks of interactions and cover multiple scales.
              These include but are not limited to systems neuroscience, gene expression, posttranscriptional regulatory processes, to ecology, but also include societal and economic systems that have complex interdependencies.
              The processes that we are most interested in are those where the data has a particular geometry known as low dimensional manifolds.
              These are geometrical objects generated from embeddings of data that allows us to predict their future behaviors, investigate causal relationships,
              find if a system is becoming unstable, find early warning signs of critical transitions or catastrophes and more.
              Our computational approaches are based on tools that have their origin in the generalized Takens theorem, and are collectively known as empirical dynamic modeling (EDM). 
              As a lab we are both a wet and dry lab where we design wet lab experiments that maximize the capabilities of our mathematical methods. 
              The results from this data driven science approach then allows us to generate mechanistic hypotheses that can be again tested experimentally for empirical confirmation. 
              This approach merges traditional hypothesis driven science and the more modern Data driven science approaches into a single virtuous cycle of discovery.

              How are sensory stimuli from the outside world processed in the brain?
              How do the sensory neuronal signals interact with the persistent brain activity?
              And how does behavior arise from neuronal activity?
              These are some of the most exciting neuroscience questions of our time.
              In the Optical Neuroimaging Unit, we develop novel techniques to image neuronal activity during behavior.
              By visualizing brain activity on a cellular level in the awake mouse we investigate how the brain processes information.
              Simultaneously, we observe the behavior in detail.
              By finding correlates between neuronal activity and behavior, we hope to address some of the mysteries of the brain.

              Extensive evidence and theoretical works suggest unique roles for the hippocampus in these processes and propose that it mnemonically processes external and internal information.
              Nevertheless, the hippocampus' specific contribution remains unclear.
              Our goal is to provide a comprehensive view on the hippocampal role in memory.
              To this end, we use in vivo electrophysiology and Ca2+ imaging in freely moving mice combined with genetic labeling, manipulation, and tracing.

              The Computational Neuroethology Unit seeks to uncover the principles governing animal behavior and its neural basis.
              To achieve this goal, the unit combines novel methods for high-resolution behavioral recording with systems neuroscience and computational approaches.
              The unit currently focuses on coleoid cephalopods (cuttlefish, octopus, and squid), a group of marine invertebrates that evolved uniquely large brains and complex behaviors.

            description: |
              The Embodied Cognitive Science Unit investigates the hypothesis that agent-environment interaction is an essential part of, rather than only a product of, cognition.
              An agent's mind is profoundly shaped by its embodiment and the world, especially in terms of social, cultural and technological mediation.
              Using methods drawn from the intersection of computer science and complex systems, the implications of this hypothesis are modeled and tested across scales from adaptive behavior to human thinking.
              Applications will advance our understanding of social cognition, addiction, and human-computer interaction.

              In the Cellular and Molecular Synaptic Function Unit, we investigate mechanisms underlying the maintenance of neurotransmission.
              As model preparations, we developed rodent giant presynaptic terminals visualized in slices or culture, and human synapses newly formed in neuronal culture differentiated from iPS cells.
              For functional analyses, we utilize patch-clamp electrophysiology, live imaging and quantitative proteomics, in combination.
              We aim at clarifying cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying dynamic brain functions, thereby obtaining effective therapeutic tools for neuronal diseases.

              When we are young, our brains adapt at the whim of our sensory environments.
              The Neuronal Mechanism for Critical Period Unit studies how this “critical period” of malleability in the young is orchestrated within the brain.
              Zebra finches, the unit's model organism of choice, learn to sing from their auditory experiences as young birds, allowing researchers to explore what is happening during this marvelous period.

              The Cognitive Neurorobotics Research Unit is dedicated to investigating the principles of embodied cognition by conducting experimental studies in synthetic neurorobotics.
              The primary goals of our research are to understand: 
              on how innate structures can be leveraged to develop cognitive constructs through iterative but limited behavioral experiences; 
              how primary intersubjectivity in social cognition can be formed through enactive and contextual interactions with others; 
              and how subjective experiences such as consciousness and free will can be scientifically and phenomenologically explained. 
              In addition, our developmental neurorobotics approach is intended to uncover the underlying mechanisms of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism.
              Through these researches, we can expect to deepen our ontological understanding of human beings, rather than simply creating another smart machine-learning robot.

              and the relation of neural mechanisms in model systems to human neurological, psychiatric and ophthalmological disorders. 
              The research interests of the faculty members range from neural development and circuit regulation to brain imaging, perception and behavior.
              Collaborating with the clinical faculty at Singapore General Hospital, the National Neuroscience Institute, 
              the Institute of Mental Health and the Singapore Eye Research Centre, the Programme has a strong footing in neurodegenerative diseases, 
              cognitive disorders, developmental disorders and diseases of the neural retina. The ultimate aim of the work carried out by the principal
              investigators in the Programme is to unravel the secret behind human intelligence and to translate their discoveries into diagnostic and
              therapeutic strategies in brain disorders like autism, Parkinson's disease and dementia.

              aims to advance fundamental knowledge of human brain function and to use this knowledge to help children and adults with psychiatric and neurological disorders.
              Our research integrates multimodal brain imaging techniques with novel computational techniques and cognitive-behavioral-clinical assays 
              to determine mechanisms underlying cognitive, emotional, and social function and dysfunction.
              Our interdisciplinary team includes researchers from multiple scientific and engineering disciplines, including cognitive neuroscience, 
              psychology, psychiatry, neurology, bioinformatics, computer science, and electrical/biomedical engineering.
              Lab projects focus on normative neurocognitive function across the human lifespan, and robust identification of cognitive and 
              neurobiological signatures of neurodevelopmental, psychiatric and neurological disorders. 
              Projects span multiple clinical disorders, including learning disabilities, autism, ADHD, anxiety and mood disorders, schizophrenia, and dementia.
              All projects typically involve working with a multidisciplinary team of researchers developing and implementing novel computational tools and 
              experimental techniques for probing brain function and dysfunction.

              Based on the unique data we obtain from novel neuromodulation, imaging, and recording technologies, we can model brain function computationally. 
              We combine brain circuit modeling with neuromodulation, imaging, and behavioral experiments in vivo to discover, test, and validate circuit mechanisms underlying brain disorders.

              In 2017, we developed a virtual reality platform to investigate the neural and autonomic mechanisms contributing to fear and anxiety.
              That involved capturing 360-degree videos of various fear-provoking situations in real life for in-lab VR movies, such as heights and claustrophobia, as well as unusual scenarios like swimming in open water with great white sharks.
              The primary objective of our VR platform is to develop new tools to help people better manage stress, anxiety and phobias in real-time, as an augment to in-clinic therapies. 
              In May 2018, we reported the discovery of two novel mammalian brain circuits as a Research Article published in Nature.
              One circuit promotes fear and anxiety-induced paralysis, while the other fosters confrontational reactions to threats.
              This led to ongoing research into the involvement of these brain regions in anxiety-related disorders such as phobias and generalized anxiety in humans.
              In 2020, we embarked on a collaborative effort with Dr. David Spiegel's laboratory in the Stanford Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, aimed to explore how specific respiration patterns synergize with the visual system to influence autonomic arousal and stress, and other brain states, including sleep.
              In 2023, the first results of that collaboration were published as a randomized controlled trial in Cell Reports Medicine, demonstrating that specific brief patterns of deliberate respiration are particularly effective in alleviating stress and enhancing mood, and improving sleep.
              In a 2021, our collaboration with Dr. Edward Chang, professor and chair of the Department of Neurological Surgery at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), was published in Current Biology, revealing that specific patterns of insular cortex neural activity may be linked to, and potentially predict, anxiety responses.

              The long term goal of the research in the laboratory is to understand the neural computations that underlie auditory perception
              with a focus on how the brain of animals and humans decipher behaviorally relevant sounds and, in particular, vocalizations used in communication.
              We believe that the neural representation of sound, the major auditory perceptual dimensions (pitch, timbre, rhythm) and the statistics of 
              natural sounds are intertwined and that understanding this 3-way relationship is critical for explaining audition.
              Our research approach is multifaceted and interdisciplinary; we combine animal behavior, human psychophysics, sensory neurophysiology
              and theoretical and computational neuroscience.

              We are an interdisciplinary team that focuses on understanding how distributed neural circuits gives rise to coordinated behaviors and perception.
              We take a two-pronged approach to this problem by conducting in vivo neuroscience experiments and developing data science tools.
              On the neuroscience side, we investigate functional organization and dynamic coordination in brain by combining in vivo multi-scale electrophysiology and optogenetics in rodents.
              This multi-modal, multi-scale approach provides the simultaneous breadth of coverage and spatio-temporal resolution required to determine neural computations at the speed-of-thought.
              On the data science side, we develop analysis tools for (neuro)-science, including statistical-machine learning algorithms, inference in dynamic graphical models, and data standards/formats.
              These interpretable and predictive tools provide enhanced insight into the generative processes that produce data.

            description: |
              The DaXi microscope is a single-objective light-sheet microscope design that combines the advantages of 
              standard single-objective microscopes with the speed, coverage, resolution, and gentleness of light-sheet microscopes.
              Its main features include a wider field of view and high-resolution imaging via a custom remote focusing objective, 
              fast volumetric imaging over larger volumes without compromising image quality or necessitating tiled acquisition, 
              fuller image coverage for large samples via multi-view imaging, and higher throughput multi-well imaging via remote coverslip placement. 
              The microscope achieves a resolution of 450 nm laterally and 2 μm axially over an imaging volume of 3,000 x 800 x 300 μm, 
              making it suitable for imaging large living samples such as developing embryos. 
              The DaXi microscope also improves sample mounting ergonomics and can be converted from upright to inverted using remote focusing. 
              The microscope has been successfully used to image various systems, including Drosophila egg chamber development, 
              zebrafish whole-brain activity, and zebrafish embryonic development, up to nine embryos at a time.

              Aquatic zebrafish are widely studied and relatively easy to culture using commercial systems. 
              However, a challenging aspect of maintaining aquatic facilities is animal feeding, which is both time- and resource-consuming. 
              To facilitate the implementation of a zebrafish colony in any laboratory, we developed an open-source fully automatic daily feeding system.
              We named our system ZAF for Zebrafish Automatic Feeder. 
              ZAF is reliable, provides a standardized amount of food to every tank, is cost-efficient and easy to build. 
              The advanced version, ZAF+, allows for the precise control of food distribution as a function of fish density per tank. 
              Here we provide all of the instructions to build the two automatic feeding systems, from the hardware and a friendly user interface 
              to the open-source python code. Importantly, the design is modular and can be scaled depending on user needs. 
              Furthermore, our results confirm that ZAF and ZAF+ do not adversely affect zebrafish culture, enabling fully automatic feeding for any aquatic facility.

            description: |
              PUMA is 3D printed open source portable modular microscope with augmented reality, fluorescence, phase contrast, epi-illumination, epi- and trans-polarisation and other features.
              You can either build it fully DIY or purchase the basic scope ready made and upgrade it as required (see below for details).
              It uses professional quality optics including the option of full Kohler illumination and oil-immersion, and has some very advanced features not usually found on even the most expensive commercially available microscopes.
              This includes a computer-controlled and programmable TFT-screen-based Spatial Light Modulator for optical Fourier filtration allowing for optimised / dynamic / adaptive apertures.
              Also, unique to any 3D printed microscope to date, an augmented reality projector system - which is also programmable.
              Some advanced applications you can do with these are AI microscopy, specimen-directed aperture optimisation, digital measurements, 3D tomography, Fourier ptychography, Schlieren phase contrast and more.
              The system is fully customisable - the original FreeCAD source files are all available on the GitHub page so you can customise the scope to meed your individual project needs.
              The PUMA system is also peer reviewed and published in the Journal of Microscopy(https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmi.13043) so you can easily reference it if you use a PUMA system for your own research.

              Each dataset has specific measured features, such as cellular volume and mitosis stage that are described in the user interface and 
              detailed in publications associated with each dataset.
              The CFE is composed of a plot, where each cell is graphed by these measured features, and a 3D viewer for in-depth visual analysis.

              The Allen Cell & Structure Segmenter (Segmenter) is a Python-based open source toolkit developed at the Allen Institute for Cell Science 
              for 3D segmentation of intracellular structures in fluorescence microscope images.
              This toolkit brings together classic image segmentation and iterative deep learning workflows first to generate initial high-quality 3D 
              intracellular structure segmentations and then to easily curate these results to generate the ground truths for building robust and accurate deep learning models.
              The toolkit takes advantage of the high replicate 3D live cell image data collected at the Allen Institute for Cell Science of 
              over 30 endogenous fluorescently tagged human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines. 
              Each cell line represents a different intracellular structure with one or more distinct localization patterns 
              within undifferentiated hiPS cells and hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes.

              dexp is a napari, CuPy, Zarr, and DASK based library for managing, processing and visualizing light-sheet microscopy datasets. 
              It consists in light-sheet specialised image processing functions (equalisation, denoising, dehazing, registration, fusion, stabilization, deskewing, deconvolution), 
              visualization functions (napari-based viewing, 2D/3D rendering, video compositing and resizing, mp4 generation), 
              as well as dataset management functions (copy, crop, concatenation, tiff conversion).
              Almost all functions are GPU accelerated via CuPy but also have a numpy-based fallback option for testing on small datasets.
              In addition to a functional API, DEXP offers a command line interface that makes it very easy for non-coders to pipeline large processing jobs all the way 
              from a large multi-terabyte raw dataset to fully processed and rendered video in MP4 format.

              Fiber photometry (FP) is an adaptable method for recording in vivo neural activity in freely behaving animals.
              It has become a popular tool in neuroscience due to its ease of use, low cost, the ability to combine FP with freely moving behavior, among other advantages.
              However, analysis of FP data can be a challenge for new users, especially those with a limited programming background.
              Here, we present Guided Photometry Analysis in Python (GuPPy), a free and open-source FP analysis tool. GuPPy is provided as a Jupyter notebook, a well-commented interactive development environment (IDE) designed to operate across platforms.
              GuPPy presents the user with a set of graphic user interfaces (GUIs) to load data and provide input parameters.
              Graphs produced by GuPPy can be exported into various image formats for integration into scientific figures.
              As an open-source tool, GuPPy can be modified by users with knowledge of Python to fit their specific needs.

            description: |
              Simulating the human brain is the holy grail of neuroscience - 
              offering a pioneering tool for understanding how our brain works and how to deal with its disorders like stroke, 
              epilepsy or neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's.
              While large-scale research initiatives simulate neurons and small brain regions at the cellular level on massively parallel hardware, 
              they are still years away from clinical applications.
              The Virtual Brain (TVB) takes a different approach and reduces complexity on the micro level to attain the macro organization: 
              a TVB model of a patient's brain generates sufficiently accurate EEG, MEG, BOLD and SEEG signals by reducing 
              the complexity millionfold through methods from statistical physics. The key is TVB's hybrid approach of merging individual anatomy 
              from brain imaging data with state-of-the-art mathematical modeling.

              The displacement integro-partial differential equation (DiPDE) population density model refers to a simulation platform for numerically solving the time evolution of coupled networks of neuronal populations.
              Instead of solving the subthreshold dynamics of individual model leaky-integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons, DiPDE models the voltage distribution of a population of neurons with a single population density equation.
              In this way, DiPDE can facilitate the fast exploration of mesoscale (population-level) network topologies, where large populations of neurons are treated as homogeneous with random fine-scale connectivity.

            description: |
              Almost any electrophysiology study of neural spiking data relies on a battery of standard analyses. 
              Raster plots and peri-stimulus time histograms aligned to stimuli and behavior provide a snapshot visual description of neural activity.
              Similarly, tuning curves are the most standard way to characterize how neurons encode stimuli or behavioral preferences.
              With increasing popularity of population recordings, maximum-likelihood decoders based on tuning models are becoming part of this standard.
              Yet, virtually every lab relies on a set of in-house analysis scripts to go from raw data to summaries.
              We want to improve this status quo in order to enable easier sharing, better reproducibility and fewer bugs.
              Spykes is a collection of Python tools to make the visualization and analysis of neural data easy and reproducible.

            description: |
              Rather than having a hard-coded signal chain, the GUI allows the user to configure processing pipelines by mixing and matching modules.
              This makes it simple to set up the software for new experiments, especially those involving closed-loop feedback.
              The GUI was inspired by software for audio processing, and is built on top of the JUCE audio processing library.
              This ensures that data is handled with low latencies, even for complex signal chains.
              Features:
              Works automatically with the Open Ephys acquisition board, Neuropixels probes, and Intan recording systems;
              Channel count limited only by computer processing speed;
              Define your own signal chain, or load a standard configuration to get up and running immediately;
              Flexible LFP display with overlaid events;
              Spike extraction and visualization for single electrodes, stereotrodes, and tetrodes;
              Built-in audio monitor;

            description: |
              Nervous system development and plasticity involves changes in cellular morphology, making morphological analysis a valuable exercise in the study of nervous system development, function and disease.
              Morphological analysis is a time-consuming exercise requiring meticulous manual tracing of cellular contours and extensions.
              We have developed a software tool, called SMorph, to rapidly analyse the morphology of cells of the nervous system.
              SMorph performs completely automated Sholl analysis. It extracts 23 morphometric features based on cell images and Sholl analysis parameters, followed by Principal Component Analysis.
              SMorph is tested on neurons, astrocytes and microglia and reveals subtle changes in cell morphology. 
              Using SMorph, we found that chronic 21-day treatment with antidepressant desipramine results in a significant structural remodeling in hippocampal astrocytes.
              Given the proposed involvement of astroglial structural changes and atrophy in major depression in humans, our results reveal a novel kind of structural plasticity induced by chronic antidepressant administration.

            description: |
              3DTracker is an open-source, versatile, and low-cost video-based behavioral analysis system developed for neuroscience. The system works as follows:
              A 3D video is reconstructed from the images of multiple (~4) depth cameras.
              Positions of body parts are estimated by fitting skeletal models to the 3D videos.
              Various behaviors are automatically detected based on the trajectories of body parts.
              Because 3DTracker works without any markers attached to the body, it is able to better capture animals' naturalistic behavior expressions.
              It also enables robust tracking of overlapped animals (e.g., during social interactions), compared to conventional 2D video based systems.
              The system has been applied for analyzing social interactions, object recognition, and neural activity during social behavior.
              The system can be used for both rats and mice. It uses a fast pose estimation algorithm potentially capable of real-time behavioral event detection.

              DANNCE (3-Dimensional Aligned Neural Network for Computational Ethology) is a convolutional neural network (CNN) 
              that calculates the 3D positions of user-defined anatomical landmarks on behaving animals from videos taken at multiple angles.
              The key innovation of DANNCE compared to existing approaches for 2D keypoint detection in animals (e.g. LEAP, DeepLabCut) 
              is that the network is fully 3D, so that it can learn about 3D image features and how cameras and landmarks relate to one another in 3D space. 
              We also pre-trained DANNCE using a large dataset of rat motion capture and synchronized video, so the standard network has extensive prior knowledge of rodent motions and poses. 
              DANNCE's ability to track landmarks transfers well to mice and other mammals, and works across different camera views, camera types, and illumination conditions.

              Where neuroscience and artificial intelligence converge.
              Neuroscience and AI work better together. AI leverages current brain research to inform its work.
              Likewise, neuroscientists use AI tools to learn more about the workings of the brain.
              This potent feedback cycle begs for great minds to join in.
              There's so much to learn and explore at the interface of these two fields.
              There are so many experts you can learn from. That's why I'm here.
              I talk with many of the best minds who work at the interface of neuroscience and AI, or have a vision about how these two fields might connect.
              You'll learn about cutting edge research, the newest theories about brains and AI, and hear first-hand from the experts how their scientific path led them to this exciting field.
              Do we need to know how brains work to develop great AI? If so, how much detail?
              Can AI pave the way to a grand theory of brain function? Or at least help us understand how brains work?
              How is machine learning different than animal learning?
              How is machine thinking different from animal thinking?
              What the heck is consciousness anyway?
